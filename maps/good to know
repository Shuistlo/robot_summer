STAGE IS GREAT
	
WHILST NAVIGATING AROUND REALIZED TOO MUCH DETAIL ON MAY CAUSES A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY
WHILST LOCALIZING REALIZED I SHOULD MAKE IT TURN FULL CIRCLES THIS HAS BEEN TUNED
DO I PLAY WITH THE ODOMETRY OR THE MAP LAUNCH?
unplug the hardware after start up and plug your mouse back in it helps a lot

gotta do elevator client testing in the gazebo world since editing the stageros launch is a damn nightmare
nah it dont work on the gazebo for some dumbass reason

wanted to use discord to talk to the robot
nah that aint happening discord dont support python 2.7

need to get rid of the shading on the maps

seems to be soem disparity betwen the world coordinates and the rviz coordintes
